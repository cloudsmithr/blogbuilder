        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Hi, Iâ€™m Ryan Smith from Las Cruces, New Mexico. With over 10 years of experience in software development, I have worked on everything from small business websites made with nothing but PHP and jQuery, to large-scale web platforms for Fortune 500 companies using the most modern cloud technologies. I am passionate about creating scalable and efficient solutions that meet business needs.</p>
        <p>I started programming as a child after grabbing my dad's Greg Perry QBasic book from the shelf (the Indiana Jones one, remember that?). I spent as many hours on the family PC as my parents would let me, creating little number-guessing games and exploring the basics of coding. This early exposure sparked a lifelong passion for writing software, and tinkering.</p>
        <p>In my free time I like to play guitar and record music, as well as hike in the beauty of New Mexico, and I am obsessed with guinea pigs.</p>
